This project is using scala 2.10 and was tested on JRE 1.6
The easiest way to run the tests is to load the .project file in eclipse. Otherwise you'll have to do it with scalac.

The solution to the string to int conversion can be found in Conversion.
The solution to the Ternary tree insertion can be found in TernaryTreeOperations.


string to int conversion is fairly straightforward.
TernaryTree insertion uses streams to keep the tree immutable which is a much more functional style appropriate for scala.
